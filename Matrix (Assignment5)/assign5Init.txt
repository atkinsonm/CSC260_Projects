Please enter whether you would like to read in matrices from the keyboard (0) or from a file (1): 0

Please specify the number of rows in the first matrix: 2

Please specify the number of columns in the first matrix: 3

Please type the elements for the matrix, a row at a time. These can all be on one line: 4 6 7 8 9 3

Please specify the number of rows in the second matrix: 1

Please specify the number of columns in the second matrix: 1

Please type the elements for the matrix, a row at a time. These can all be on one line: 2

You entered for matrix 1: 
 4+0i 6+0i 7+0i
 8+0i 9+0i 3+0i


And for matrix 2: 
 2+0i


Here is an example of addition between the two matrices you input: 
The matrices could not be added because they are not of the same size. Please try again with two same-sized matrices.
Here is an example of matrix 1 plus the complex number 3+5i: 

 4+0i 6+0i 7+0i
 8+0i 9+0i 3+0i


		 + 

		3+5i

		 = 

 7+5i 9+5i 10+5i
 11+5i 12+5i 6+5i

Here is an example of multiplication between the two matrices you input: 
The matrices could not be multiplied because the number of columns in matrix 1 does not equal the number of rows in matrix 2. Please try again with two appropriate matrices.
Here is an example of multiplication between matrix 2 and the complex number 3+5i: 

 2+0i


		 * 

		3+5i
